# BSE-100-Filings

The script selects the BSE company code from the CSV file 'list.csv' and downloads all Annual Reports from 2010 to 2020 into the folder of the script organized into folders by the name of respective companies. The CSV file can be edited to include other companies. The script can be modified to download reports for subsequent years in the future.
